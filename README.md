#The Asterisk(R) Open Source PBX
Asterisk is an Open Source PBX and telephony toolkit. It is, in a sense, middleware between Internet and telephony channels on the bottom, and Internet and telephony applications at the top. However, Asterisk supports more telephony interfaces than just Internet telephony. Asterisk also has a vast amount of support for traditional PSTN telephony, as well.

For more information on the project itself, please visit the Asterisk home page and the official wiki. In addition you'll find lots of information compiled by the Asterisk community at voip-info.org.

There is a book on Asterisk published by O'Reilly under the Creative Commons License. It is available in book stores as well as in a downloadable version on the asteriskdocs.org web site.
